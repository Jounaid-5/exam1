### What is the e-closure of all states
E(p0)=p0,p3
E(p1)=p1
E(p2)=p2,p5
E(p3)=p3
E(p4)=p3,p4
E(p5)=p5
### What states are reached, write the list of states after the = sign, separated by comman
## when the input is
aa=p2,p5
bbc=empty
aab=empty
aaab=p3,p4
## Describe the language of N, free style.

L(N)=(aaa)*(aac* U b*)
